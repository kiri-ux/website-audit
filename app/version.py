Build identity.

Surfaced in the UI header, the report footer, and /healthz so you can confirm
which code is actually live before trusting a run. Deploying and re-running
against a stale container is an easy mistake to make and a hard one to spot —
the report looks plausible either way.

BUMP `BUILD` whenever you ship a change whose effect you need to verify visually.

The ingest wrote the rows, the detail and the score and left the status where it found it - fine on a finished audit being re-scanned, an infinite loop on a blocked one: the panel was still there after a successful upload, the page reloaded itself as promised, the extension saw the panel and started again. A capture that answers the question is now the result of the run. Industry is multi-select, because a furniture retailer that also does financing is under both sets of rules and a single-value field made somebody choose which half of the law to check")
