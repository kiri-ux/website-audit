Build identity.

Surfaced in the UI header, the report footer, and /healthz so you can confirm
which code is actually live before trusting a run. Deploying and re-running
against a stale container is an easy mistake to make and a hard one to spot —
the report looks plausible either way.

BUMP `BUILD` whenever you ship a change whose effect you need to verify visually.

A site that ignores the signal still fails both, and the notice at collection is unaffected because no signal alternative exists for it. The fail text now names the single combined link option.
