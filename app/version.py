Build identity.

Surfaced in the UI header, the report footer, and /healthz so you can confirm
which code is actually live before trusting a run. Deploying and re-running
against a stale container is an easy mistake to make and a hard one to spot —
the report looks plausible either way.

BUMP `BUILD` whenever you ship a change whose effect you need to verify visually.

The bands are the real phases in the real order so the number cannot go backwards; inside a band it interpolates only where there is something to count - pages crawled against the cap, or the page the consent walk is on - and sits at the band floor otherwise, because a bar that moves on a timer is a lie with an animation on it. The caption says which of the two it is. The consent walk now reports page N of M, so a multi-page consent scan stops looking frozen")
