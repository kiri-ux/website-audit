Build identity.

Surfaced in the UI header, the report footer, and /healthz so you can confirm
which code is actually live before trusting a run. Deploying and re-running
against a stale container is an easy mistake to make and a hard one to spot —
the report looks plausible either way.

BUMP `BUILD` whenever you ship a change whose effect you need to verify visually.
